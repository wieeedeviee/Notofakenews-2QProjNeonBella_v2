						<h2>  How do fake news and misinformation spread? </h2>
						<hr class="hr3" style="position: relative; top: -20px;">
					</header>
					<p>	You are misinformed with disinformation. </p>
					<p>	
						Fake news and misinformation spread “like a virus” that gets passed on from person to person.  
						According to research, exposure to multiple fake news, especially from an influential and 
						seemingly reliable source, can make a person much more vulnerable and prone to “infection” 
						(Andrews, 2019). 
					</p>
					<p>	
						Before social media, news spread through rumors whispered between townspeople or through radio 
						or newsprint.  Political propagandists who want to influence the public use these Jurassic ways to 
						spread biased perceptions and continually spread misinformation until “made-up”  news appears to 
						be the ”truth.”  
					</p>
					<h3> Present Technology </h3>
					<p>	
						But as technology advances, the internet has become the primary source of information for people 
						across the globe.   The web provided us better and more efficient communication, which is helpful 
						in faster dissemination of information, false ones included.  
					</p>
					<h3> Social Media </h3>
					<p>	
						Social media is the internet’s interactive for sharing a variety of thoughts, ideas, content, and 
						information, reliable or not (Britannica, 2022), that gained billions of users.  Currently, it is 
						the central platform of vast communication as well as a prominent source of information.  As a 
						result, it has become powerful and influential that misinformation is highly susceptible.
					</p>
					<h3> They disinform to misinform. </h3>
					<p>	
						Internet bots and trolls, the main perpetrators of fake news and disinformation, lurk within the 5 
						billion users of the vast network.  Bots are machines used for vast data-gathering, retrieving 
						unreliable information from the web.  Then, they spread gathered phony information throughout social 
						media, automated and repetitively.  Trolls are the real-life counterparts of bots.  They are real 
						people who spread disinformation throughout the web by creating multiple fake accounts and posting 
						repetitive, fallacious content (CITS, n.d.).  
					</p>

					<p>	
						Since social media has become very influential, people tend to straight-away treat it as reliable and 
						truthful.  Unlike bots that can be easily spotted for potential misinformation, trolls are much more 
						dangerous as they are convincing and persuasive, having human intelligence.  They are who we should be 
						the wariest of.

						<h2> The Dangers of False News and Disinformation </h2>
						<hr class="hr3" style="position: relative; top: -20px;">
					</header>
	
					<h3> Fake News is Self-Serving. </h3>
					<p>
						Fake news is false advertising to drive web traffic to sites to make money.  In the Philippines, fake 
						news is spread primarily thru Facebook.  Self-serving fake news can be in the form of propaganda -  
						spreading disinformation to promote selfish agendas.
					</p>
					<h3> Disinformation is Harmful. </h3>
					<p>
						There is danger when people are disinformed.  It can cause destruction – physical or mental, just like 
						when <a href= "https://www.adl.org/resources/tools-and-strategies/dangers-disinformation" target="_blank" class="special"><span>
						Trump supporters made riots in the US after the elections in January 2021 </span> </a> (ADL, 2021).  
						Bluffs about someone or a group of people can ruin their reputation.  Disinformation can lead to cyberbullying that destroys self-esteem and might lead to 
						taking of one's life as they cannot live up to the pressure of being linked to internet scandals.  Red-tagging or 
						spreading of lies to “tag” people as “communists” caused the lives of innocent civilians who are 
						progressive and critical of the government.  Disinformation can affect the ways of society by distorting 
						ideas and beliefs.  Historical revisionism, as an example, is a conscious alteration of accounts and records, 
						which is an insult to our forefathers who knew and passed on the facts and fought for truth and a just society.
